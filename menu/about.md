I'm a normalien at ENS Ulm, graduated from École Polytechnique, majored in Mathematics and Computer Science, with minor in Biology. My research interest lies mainly within the studies of DNA/RNA structure from algorithmic point of view, but I'm also interested with various math topics.

This stie is mostly a compilation of my own research notes, many of which are not suitable for publication, on Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, and intersection thereof.
