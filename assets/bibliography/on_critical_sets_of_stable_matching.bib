@article{Karp1972,
abstract = {A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

abstract = {We define a natural variant of NP, MAX NP, and also a subclass called MAX SNP. These are classes of optimization problems, and in fact contain several natural, well-studied ones. We show that problems in these classes can be approximated with some bounded error. Furthermore, we show that a number of common optimization problems are complete for MAX SNP under a kind of careful transformation (called L-reduction) that preserves approximability. It follows that such a complete problem has a polynomial-time approximation scheme iff the whole class does. These results may help explain the lack of progress on the approximability of a host of optimization problems. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

That is, we consider the relaxation of the set cover problem over a universe of n elements and a collection of m sets, where each set can be picked fractionally, with a value in [0, 1]. We present a randomized (1+)- approximation algorithm that makes p passes over the data, and uses eO(mnO(1/p) +n) memory space. The algorithm works in both the set arrival and the edge arrival models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first streaming result for the fractional set cover problem. We obtain our results by employing the multiplicative weights update framework in the streaming settings.},

abstract = {We present new pivot rules for the Simplex method for LPs over 0/1 polytopes. We show that the number of non-degenerate steps taken using these rules is strongly polynomial and even linear in the dimension or in the number of variables. Our bounds on the number of steps are asymptotically optimal on several well-known combinatorial polytopes. Our analysis is based on the geometry of 0/1 polytopes and novel modifications to the classical Steepest-Edge and Shadow-Vertex pivot rules. We draw interesting connections between our pivot rules and other well-known algorithms in combinatorial optimization.},

abstract = { We consider an infinite sequence of customers of types  and an infinite sequence of servers of types  where a server of type j can serve a subset of customer types C ( j ) and where a customer of type i can be served by a subset of server types S ( i ). We assume that the types of customers and servers in the infinite sequences are random, independent, and identically distributed, and that customers and servers are matched according to their order in the sequence, on a first-come–first-served (FCFS) basis. We investigate this process of infinite bipartite matching. In particular, we are interested in the rate r i , j  that customers of type i are assigned to servers of type j . We present a countable state Markov chain to describe this process, and for some previously unsolved instances, we prove ergodicity and existence of limiting rates, and calculate r i , j  . },

@article{Busic2013,
abstract = {We consider the bipartite matching model of customers and servers introduced by Caldentey, Kaplan and Weiss (2009). Customers and servers play symmetrical roles. There are finite sets C and S of customer and server classes, respectively. Time is discrete and at each time step one customer and one server arrive in the system according to a joint probability measure $\mu$ on C × S, independently of the past. Also, at each time step, pairs of matched customers and servers, if they exist, depart from the system. Authorized matchings are given by a fixed bipartite graph (C, S,E ⊂ C×S). Amatching policy is chosen, which decides how to match when there are several possibilities. Customers/servers that cannot be matched are stored in a buffer. The evolution of the model can be described by a discrete-time Markov chain. We study its stability under various admissible matching policies, including ML (match the longest), MS (match the shortest), FIFO (match the oldest), Random (match uniformly), and Priority. There exist natural necessary conditions for stability (independent of the matching policy) defining the maximal possible stability region. For some bipartite graphs, we prove that the stability region is indeed maximal for any admissible matching policy. For the ML policy, we prove that the stability region is maximal for any bipartite graph. For the MS and Priority policies, we exhibit a bipartite graph with a nonmaximal stability region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Applied Probability Trust.},

abstract = {We introduce and study a new model that we call the matching model. Items arrive one by one in a buffer and depart from it as soon as possible but by pairs. The items of a departing pair are said to be matched. There is a finite set of classes for the items, and the allowed matchings depend on the classes, according to a matching graph on . Upon arrival, an item may find several possible matches in the buffer. This indeterminacy is resolved by a matching policy. When the sequence of classes of the arriving items is independent and identically distributed, the sequence of buffer-content is a Markov chain, whose stability is investigated. In particular, we prove that the model may be stable if and only if the matching graph is nonbipartite.},

abstract = {Given a k-uniform hyper-graph, the Ek-Vertex-Cover problem is to find the smallest subset of vertices that intersects every hyper-edge. We present a new multilayered PCP construction that extends the Raz verifier. This enables us to prove that Ek-Vertex-Cover is NP-hard to approximate within factor (k -1 - $\epsilon$) for any k ≥ 3 and any $\epsilon$ > 0. The result is essentially tight as this problem can be easily approximated within factor k. Our construction makes use of the biased Long-Code and is analyzed using combinatorial properties of s-wise t-intersecting families of subsets.},
