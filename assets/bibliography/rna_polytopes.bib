abstract = {Free energy minimization has been the most popular method for RNA secondary structure prediction for decades. It is based on a set of empirical free energy change parameters derived from experiments using a nearest-neighbor model. In this study, a program, MaxExpect, that predicts RNA secondary structure by maximizing the expected base-pair accuracy, is reported. This approach was first pioneered in the program CONTRAfold, using pair probabilities predicted with a statistical learning method. Here, a partition function calculation that utilizes the free energy change nearest-neighbor parameters is used to predict base-pair probabilities as well as probabilities of nucleotides being single-stranded. MaxExpect predicts both the optimal structure (having highest expected pair accuracy) and suboptimal structures to serve as alternative hypotheses for the structure. Tested on a large database of different types of RNA, the maximum expected accuracy structures are, on average, of higher accuracy than minimum free energy structures. Accuracy is measured by sensitivity, the percentage of known base pairs correctly predicted, and positive predictive value (PPV), the percentage of predicted pairs that are in the known structure. By favoring double-strandedness or single-strandedness, a higher sensitivity or PPV of prediction can be favored, respectively. Using MaxExpect, the average PPV of optimal structure is improved from 66% to 68% at the same sensitivity level (73%) compared with free energy minimization.},

Graphical models that have been applied to these problems include hidden Markov models for annotation, tree models for phylogenetics, and pair hidden Markov models for alignment. A single algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, solves many of the inference problems that are associated with different statistical models. This article introduces the polytope propagation algorithm for computing the Newton polytope of an observation from a graphical model. This algorithm is a geometric version of the sum-product algorithm and is used to analyze the parametric behavior of maximum a posteriori inference calculations for graphical models.},

abstract = {This article presents a new version of the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm that circumvents the shortcomings introduced by degenerate geometries. The original Johnson algorithm and Backup procedure are replaced by a distance subalgorithm that is faster and accurate to machine precision, thus guiding the GJK algorithm toward a shorter search path in less computing time. Numerical tests demonstrate that this effectively is a more robust procedure. In particular, when the objects are found in contact, the newly proposed subalgorithm runs from 15% to 30% times faster than the original one. The improved performance has a significant impact on various applications, such as real-time simulations and collision avoidance systems. Altogether, the main contributions made to the GJK algorithm are faster convergence rate and reduced computational time. These improvements may be easily added into existing implementations; furthermore, engineering applications that require solutions of distance queries to machine precision can now be tackled using the GJK algorithm.},

abstract = {In this paper we present several results on the expected complexity of a convex hull of $n$ points chosen uniformly and independently from a convex shape. (i) We show that the expected number of vertices of the convex hull of $n$ points, chosen uniformly and independently from a disk is $O(n^{1/3})$, and $O(k \log{n})$ for the case a convex polygon with $k$ sides. Those results are well known (see \cite{rs-udkhv-63,r-slcdn-70,ps-cgi-85}), but we believe that the elementary proof given here are simpler and more intuitive. (ii) Let $\D$ be a set of directions in the plane, we define a generalized notion of convexity induced by $\D$, which extends both rectilinear convexity and standard convexity. We prove that the expected complexity of the $\D$-convex hull of a set of $n$ points, chosen uniformly and independently from a disk, is $O(n^{1/3} + \sqrt{n\alpha(\D)})$, where $\alpha(\D)$ is the largest angle between two consecutive vectors in $\D$. This result extends the known bounds for the cases of rectilinear and standard convexity. (iii) Let $\B$ be an axis parallel hypercube in $\Re^d$. We prove that the expected number of points on the boundary of the quadrant hull of a set $S$ of $n$ points, chosen uniformly and independently from $\B$ is $O(\log^{d-1}n)$. Quadrant hull of a set of points is an extension of rectilinear convexity to higher dimensions. In particular, this number is larger than the number of maxima in $S$, and is also larger than the number of points of $S$ that are vertices of the convex hull of $S$. Those bounds are known \cite{bkst-anmsv-78}, but we believe the new proof is simpler.},

abstract = {Minimum free energy prediction of RNA secondary structures is based on the Nearest Neighbor Thermodynamics Model. While such predictions are typically good, the accuracy can vary widely even for short sequences, and the branching thermodynamics are an important factor in this variance. Recently, the simplest model for multiloop energetics—a linear function of the number of branches and unpaired nucleotides—was found to be the best. Subsequently, a parametric analysis demonstrated that per family accuracy can be improved by changing the weightings in this linear function. However, the extent of improvement was not known due to the ad hoc method used to find the new parameters. Here we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that finds the set of optimal parameters with the highest average accuracy for a given set of sequences. Our analysis shows that the previous ad hoc parameters are nearly optimal for tRNA and 5S rRNA sequences on both training and testing sets. Moreover, cross-family improvement is possible but more difficult because competing parameter regions favor different families. The results also indicate that restricting the unpaired nucleotide penalty to small values is warranted. This reduction makes analyzing longer sequences using the present techniques more feasible.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract DNA secondary structure plays an important role in biology, genotyping diagnostics, a variety of molecular biology techniques, in vitro–selected DNA catalysts, nanotechnology, and DNA-based computing. Accurate prediction of DNA secondary structure and hybridization using dynamic programming algorithms requires a database of thermodynamic parameters for several motifs including Watson-Crick base pairs, internal mismatches, terminal mismatches, terminal dangling ends, hairpins, bulges, internal loops, and multibranched loops. To make the database useful for predictions under a variety of salt conditions, empirical equations for monovalent and magnesium dependence of thermodynamics have been developed. Bimolecular hybridization is often inhibited by competing unimolecular folding of a target or probe DNA. Powerful numerical methods have been developed to solve multistate-coupled equilibria in bimolecular and higher-order complexes. This review presents the current parameter set available for making accurate DNA structure predictions and also points to future directions for improvement.},

abstract = {RNA molecules play important roles, including catalysis of chemical reactions and control of gene expression, and their functions largely depend on their folded structures. Since determining these structures by biochemical means is expensive, there is increased demand for computational predictions of RNA structures. One computational approach is to find the secondary structure (a set of base pairs) that minimizes a free energy function for a given RNA conformation. The forces driving RNA folding can be approximated by means of a free energy model, which associates a free energy parameter to a distinct considered feature. The main goal of this thesis is to develop state-of-the-art computational approaches that can significantly increase the accuracy (i.e., maximize the number of correctly predicted base pairs) of RNA secondary structure prediction methods, by improving and refining the parameters of the underlying RNA free energy model. We propose two general approaches to estimate RNA free energy parameters. The Constraint Generation (CG) approach is based on iteratively generating constraints that enforce known structures to have energies lower than other structures for the same molecule. The Boltzmann Likelihood (BL) approach infers a set of RNA free energy parameters which maximize the conditional likelihood of a set of known RNA structures. We discuss several variants and extensions of these two approaches, including a linear Gaussian Bayesian network that defines relationships between features. Overall, BL gives slightly better results than CG, but it is over ten times more expensive to run. In addition, CG requires software that is much simpler to implement. We obtain significant improvements in the accuracy of RNA minimum free energy secondary structure prediction with and without pseudoknots (regions of non-nested base pairs), when measured on large sets of RNA molecules with known structures. For the Turner model, which has been the gold-standard model without pseudoknots for more than a decade, the average prediction accuracy of our new parameters increases from 60% to 71%. For two models with pseudoknots, we obtain an increase of 9% and 6%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our parameters are currently state-of-the-art for the three considered models.},

abstract = {A computer method is presented for finding the most stable secondary structures in long single-stranded RNAs. It is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing codes. The time required for its application increases as N3 for a chain N nucleotides long. As many as 1000 nucleotides can be searched in a single run. The approach is systematic and builds an optimal structure in a straightforward inductive procedure based on an exact mathematical algorithm. Two simple half-matrices are constructed and the best folded form is read directly from the second matrix by a simple back-tracking procedure. The program utilizes published values for base-pairing energies to compute one structure with the lowest free energy.},

@article{Kuhnlein2021,
abstract = {Can replication and translation emerge in a single mechanism via self-assembly? The key molecule, transfer RNA (tRNA), is one of the most ancient molecules and contains the genetic code. Our experiments show how a pool of oligonucleotides, adapted with minor mutations from tRNA, spontaneously formed molecular assemblies and replicated information autonomously using only reversible hybridization under thermal oscillations. The pool of cross-complementary hairpins self-selected by agglomeration and sedimentation. The metastable DNA hairpins bound to a template and then interconnected by hybridization. Thermal oscillations separated replicates from their templates and drove an exponential, cross-catalytic replication. The molecular assembly could encode and replicate binary sequences with a replication fidelity corresponding to 85–90 % per nucleotide. The replication by a self-assembly of tRNA-like sequences suggests that early forms of tRNA could have been involved in molecular replication. This would link the evolution of translation to a mechanism of molecular replication.},
